	abstract = {Cancer chemotherapy has been the most common cancer treatment. However, it has side effects that kill both tumor cells and immune cells, which can ravage the patient’s immune system. Chemotherapy should be administered depending on the patient’s immunity as well as the level of cancer cells. Thus, we need to design an efficient treatment protocol. In this work, we study a feedback control problem of tumor-immune system to design an optimal chemotherapy strategy. For this, we first propose a mathematical model of tumor-immune interactions and conduct stability analysis of two equilibria. Next, the feedback control is found by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. Here, we use an upwind finite-difference method for a numerical approximate solution of the HJB equation. Numerical simulations show that the feedback control can help determine the treatment protocol of chemotherapy for tumor and immune cells depending on the side effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract In practice, many physical systems, including physiological ones, can be considered whose input can take only positive quantities. However, most of the conventional control methods do not support the positivity of the main input data to the system. Furthermore, the parameters of these systems, similar to other non-linear systems, are either not accurately identified or may change over time. Therefore, it is reasonable to design a controller that is robust against system uncertainties. A robust positive-input control method is proposed for the automatic treatment of targeted anti-angiogenic therapy implementing a recently published tumour growth model based on experiments conducted on mouse models. The backstepping (BS) approach is applied to design the positive input controller using sensory data of tumour volume as feedback. Unlike previous studies, the proposed controller only requires the measurement of tumour volume and does not require the measurement of inhibitor level. The exponential stability of the controlled system is proved mathematically using the Lyapunov theorem. As a result, the convergence rate of the tumour volume can be controlled, which is an important issue in cancer treatment. Moreover, the robustness of the system against parametric uncertainties is verified mathematically using the Lyapunov theorem. The real-time simulation results-based (OPAL-RT) and comparisons with previous studies confirm the theoretical findings and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Stability analysis is carried out for all steady states in each treatment model. Conditions are derived under which recurrence of tumors can be prevented when the amount of applied drugs are reduced. Analysis of the model shows that the tumor can be eliminated with a lower dose of chemotherapy if it is combined with virotherapy. The existence of an optimal control set, and optimality of the model are discussed. The optimal control problem relative to the model is designed in a way to reduce the number of tumor cells and the amount of chemotherapeutic drugs and at the same time to increase the positive effect of virotherapy to improve the immune system, thereby causing a reduction in patient’s recovery time.}

Originally conceived to work both in deterministic and stochastic frameworks, it is shown that, except for the case of very low number of tumour cells, the deterministic approach is appropriate to characterize the system behaviour, especially for control planning purposes. Two alternative control approaches are here investigated. One trivially assumes a constant infusion of external drug administration, the other is designed according to a state-feedback control scheme, with complete or partial knowledge of the state. Pros and cons of both control laws are investigated, showing that the tumour size at the beginning of the therapy plays a role of paramount importance for fixed infusion therapies, whilst only state-feedback laws can eradicate arbitrarily large tumours.}

In this review, we provide an overview of data-driven model predictive control (MPC) methods for controlling unknown systems with guarantees on systems-theoretic properties such as stability, robustness, and constraint satisfaction. The considered approaches rely on the fundamental lemma from behavioral theory in order to predict input–output trajectories directly from data. We cover various setups, ranging from linear systems and noise-free data to more realistic formulations with noise and nonlinearities, and we provide an overview of different techniques to ensure guarantees for the closed-loop system. Moreover, we discuss avenues for future research that may further improve the theoretical understanding and practical applicability of data-driven MPC."

Our proposed ODeePC method leverages a primal–dual algorithm with real-time measurement feedback to iteratively compute the corresponding real-time optimal control policy as system conditions change. The proposed ODeePC conceptual-wise resembles standard adaptive system identification and model predictive control (MPC), but it provides a new alternative for the standard methods. ODeePC is enabled by computationally efficient methods that exploit the special structure of the Hankel matrices in the context of DeePC with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and primal–dual algorithm We provide theoretical guarantees regarding the asymptotic behavior of ODeePC, and we demonstrate its performance through numerical examples.}

			abstract = {In this paper, a novel model predictive control (MPC) for constrained (non-square) linear systems to track piecewise constant references is presented. This controller ensures constraint satisfaction and asymptotic evolution of the system to any target which is an admissible steady-state. Therefore, any sequence of piecewise admissible setpoints can be tracked without error. If the target steady state is not admissible, the controller steers the system to the closest admissible steady state. These objectives are achieved by: (i) adding an artificial steady state and input as decision variables, (ii) using a modified cost function to penalize the distance from the artificial to the target steady state (iii) considering an extended terminal constraint based on the notion of invariant set for tracking. The control law is derived from the solution of a single quadratic programming problem which is feasible for any target. Furthermore, the proposed controller provides a larger domain of attraction (for a given control horizon) than the standard MPC and can be explicitly computed by means of multiparametric programming tools. On the other hand, the extra degrees of freedom added to the MPC may cause a loss of optimality that can be arbitrarily reduced by an appropriate weighting of the offset cost term.}

If the desired steady state changes, the MPC controller must be redesigned to guarantee the feasibility of the optimization problem, the admissible evolution as well as the asymptotic stability. In this paper a novel formulation of the MPC is proposed to track varying references. This controller ensures the feasibility of the optimization problem, constraint satisfaction and asymptotic evolution of the system to any admissible steady-state.

This review aims to provide a structured and accessible guide on linear data-driven predictive control methods and practices for people in both academia and the industry seeking to approach and explore this field. To do so, we first discuss standard methods, such as subspace predictive control (SPC), and data-enabled predictive control (DeePC), but we also include newer hybrid approaches to DPC, such as γ–data-driven predictive control and generalized data-driven predictive control. For all presented data-driven predictive controllers we provide a detailed analysis regarding the underlying theory, implementation details and design guidelines, including an overview of methods to guarantee closed-loop stability and promising extensions towards handling nonlinear systems. The performance of the reviewed DPC approaches is compared via simulations on two benchmark examples from the literature, allowing us to provide a comprehensive overview of the different techniques in the presence of noisy data.}

We continue with more complex models involving evolution of drug resistance and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. Then, we consider two more recent areas: angiogenesis of tumors and molecular signaling within and among cells. We discuss biological background and mathematical techniques of this field, which has a large although only partly realized potential for contributing to cancer treatment.}

		abstract="This work discusses the nonlinear modeling of healthy and cancer cell population growth under the influence of radiotherapy, and proposes predictive control techniques to determine the optimal dose for tumor control, while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Radiation effects are modelled by a linear-quadratic formalism, coupled with a novel population-specific delayed dose response. Numerical simulations of the open- and closed-loop system are conducted, and robustness against model uncertainty is studied. Results illustrate the controller's performance when dealing with imperfect information and unexpected system behavior, and how it can be tuned to produce the desired treatment outcome. However, optimal operation is conditioned by a limited prediction horizon, as well as strict adherence to treatment schedules and dose restrictions.",
