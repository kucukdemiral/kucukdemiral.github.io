Dr. Ibrahim Kucukdemiral is a Reader in the Department of Applied Science at the School of Computing, Engineering, and Built Environment at Glasgow Caledonian University. He serves as Vice Chair of the IEEE Control Systems Chapter of the UK & Ireland Section and holds the position of Conference Coordinator Officer for the IEEE UK & Ireland Section. Additionally, he is the Chair of the Industrial Advisory Board for the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering departments and leads the Robotics for the Common Good research group. 

Dr. Kucukdemiral completed his BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering at Yildiz Technical University (YTU) in 1997, 1999, and 2002, respectively. His early academic career spanned from a Research and Teaching Assistant position at YTU (1998-2004) to roles as Assistant Professor (2004-2010), Associate Professor (2010-2015), and Full Professor (2015-2017) at the same university. He was instrumental in establishing the Control and Automation Engineering department at YTU.

Dr. Kucukdemiralâ€™s research interests cover a broad spectrum, including robust, optimal, and adaptive control systems; nonlinear robust model predictive control; data-driven control; and applications in mechatronics, digital communication systems, and robotics. He has been actively involved in significant research collaborations, such as the EPSRC-funded ROBMAN project on robust robotic manipulation underwater.

A Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) in the UK and a senior member of IEEE, Dr. Kucukdemiral has contributed extensively to academia through teaching, supervision, and module leadership. He has taught approximately 20 different modules at institutions such as YTU, the Turkish Airforce Academy, and the University of Sharjah in the UAE. 

Dr. Kucukdemiral serves on the editorial boards of Ocean Engineering and the Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences. He has supervised five PhD students to completion and continues to provide consultation and review services for various industrial and academic projects globally.

Dr. Kucukdemiral is a member of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) and serves in the EPSRC Peer Review College. He is also serving as an external examiner for some universities in England.

Dr. Kucukdemiral is also a member of the Thematic Leadership Group for Robotics and Autonomous Systems, part of a strategic partnership among Scotland's universities. This collaboration involves industry and government stakeholders and aims to secure Scotland's standing as a world-class center of research excellence and a globally competitive force in engineering. In this role, he represents Glasgow Caledonian University, contributing his expertise in robotics to enhance research and development initiatives across Scotland.
