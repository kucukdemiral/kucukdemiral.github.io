        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the homepage of Dr. Ibrahim Beklan Küçükdemiral at Glasgow Caledonian University.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim Kucukdemiral is a Reader in the Department of Applied Science at the School of Computing, Engineering, and Built Environment at Glasgow Caledonian University. He serves as Chair of the IEEE Control Systems Chapter of the UK & Ireland Section, committee member of the IEEE Region 8 Conference Coordination Committee member. Additionally, he is the Chair of the Industrial Advisory Board for the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering departments and leads the Robotics for the Common Good research group.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kucukdemiral completed his BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering at Yildiz Technical University (YTU) in 1997, 1999, and 2002, respectively. His early academic career spanned from a Research and Teaching Assistant position at YTU (1998-2004) to roles as Assistant Professor (2004-2010), Associate Professor (2010-2015), and Full Professor (2015-2017) at the same university. He was instrumental in establishing the Control and Automation Engineering department at YTU in 2008.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kucukdemiral’s research interests cover a range of control engineering topics, including robust, optimal, and adaptive control systems, model predictive control, computational and data-driven control and their applications in mechatronics, renewable energy systems, autonomous vehicles and robotics. He has been actively involved in significant research collaborations, such as the EPSRC-funded ROBMAN project on robust robotic manipulation underwater.</p>
        <p>As a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) in the UK, a senior member of IEEE, and a member of IFAC, Dr. Kucukdemiral has contributed extensively to academia through teaching, supervision, and module leadership. He has taught approximately over two dozens of different modules at institutions such as YTU, the Turkish Airforce Academy, and the University of Sharjah in the UAE.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kucukdemiral is an editor of Results in Engineering (Q1) and serves on the editorial boards of Ocean Engineering (Q1) and the Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences. He has supervised five PhD students to completion so far and continues to provide consultation and review services for various industrial and academic projects globally.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kucukdemiral serves in the EPSRC Peer Review College. He is also serving as an external examiner for some universities in England. He is also a member of the Thematic Leadership Group for Robotics and Autonomous Systems, part of a strategic partnership among Scotland's universities. This collaboration involves industry and government stakeholders and aims to secure Scotland's standing as a world-class center of research excellence and a globally competitive force in engineering. In this role, he represents Glasgow Caledonian University, contributing his expertise in robotics to enhance research and development initiatives across Scotland.</p>
